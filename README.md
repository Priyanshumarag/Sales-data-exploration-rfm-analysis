# Sales Data Exploration and Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project involves comprehensive exploration and analysis of sales data to extract actionable insights and drive strategic decision-making. Using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique, customer behavior was analyzed to develop an effective segmentation strategy. 

## Deliverables
1. **RFM Analysis:**
   - Analyzed customer transactions to calculate RFM scores.
   - Segmented customers into categories (e.g., high-value, at-risk, dormant) based on their RFM scores.
2. **Tableau Dashboards:** 
   - Developed two interactive dashboards for visualizing sales data and customer segmentation insights:
     - [Sales Dashboard 1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/priyanshu.marag/viz/Sales_Dashboard_1_17333415916950/salesDash1)
     - [Sales Dashboard 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/priyanshu.marag/viz/Sales_Dashboard_2_17333425351350/SalesDash2)
